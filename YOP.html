		<h4>Manifesto</h4>
		<p>Are you sick and tired of empty words? Unfortunately we've all seen such actions of that on cpe. Throughout this community theirs an abundance of false leaders wanting quick clout.  Such leaders always run out of motivation, fail to follow through with actions, and lie about their intent. The party opposition is no better when it comes to the elections.<br><br>
 A hated 2020 pot pvper known as Adeniod, be could never follow through with his intended actions of spawn projects such as  Ocean Draining. The same individual whom attempted to get a java minecraft player to run as his possible vice president. Such actions show Adeniods true intent. He does not care for the server which is why he would attempt to run along side with an outsider (whom doesn't understand nor know our community and culture) as his own vp.<br><br>

So whom else could we vote for you ask? Well the answer certainly would not be Commie. Such a "player", if we can even call him that (for he has been inactive on this server for over a year) does not understand nor has even tried to make a commitment on the server in recent times. If we vote for him, the election idea and event would be dead. The man just wants clout as an elected, but his previous actions show that of a man whom can not take charge.<br><br>
So who the hell should I vote for, you may be wondering. Unfortunately I cannot tell you that answer, however what I can tell you is the truth. Sackthebaggins has over 130+ videos related to cpe. Zender has had multiple youtube account terminations on youtube for giving his followers his explicit and funny songs. Both individuals are committed to the community, with such examples being both individuals active within the server, actively making and producing content for the community; as well as countless server victories such as finding Ginjeets grace and getting unbanned from the server, leading the winning team to the Block war victory for Diorite team, ending multiple tyrannic groups and individuals such as TSC and Iprop as well as keeping their words to the justice they promised to victims of such horrendous acts.<br><br>
This will not stop there however. If you allow Zender and I to be your elected, we will do so much more and greater. Our plans when in office is to bring the community together. We plan by doing such events by throwing spawn parties, achieving spawn projects, constructing a magnificent base for the community and it's future electives known as the CPE Capital. During our time in office you can expect daily vc's and involvement from us as we gather the community together for greatness once again. Let's make CPE great again.</p>

		  Meth heads make vital members in society. While most these kids have to go to school you can guarantee SackTheBaggins will be calling of work days sick while snorting insane quantities of meth to do the hard work that his competitors cannot. If you want a go getter, you need to vote for a meth head. Vote Zender and Sack and you will not be dissapointed </div>
